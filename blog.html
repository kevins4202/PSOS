        <p style="font-family: Jaldi; font-size: 42px;margin-top: 10px;">Viral Skincare Trends (and if you should actually be participating)</p>
        Skincare trends have been blowing up on Tiktok and Instagram. These trends seem to make social media influencers’ skin look radiant and flawless, but do they really work? And if they do, are they actually good for your skin? Let’s dive into some of the internet’s most popular skincare trends and see if you should really be implementing them into your skincare routine. 

        <p style="font-family: Jaldi; font-size: 36px;margin-top: 10px;">Contouring your face with self tanner</p>
        Influencers like Abby Baffoe, Poppy March, and Juliana Shiel have captivated Tik Tok with their unique contouring technique: they dab self-tanning mousse onto their cheekbones, forehead, and nose with a beauty blender to create a contoured effect. The stunning results have led millions of people to follow their lead in creating bronzed-up looks even during winter. However, leaving tanning mousse on your face overnight isn’t always the best idea. Dihydroxyacetone is the ingredient in tanning products that gives you a tan and is present in most tanning mousses like St. Tropez Gradual Tan Classic Everyday Mousse. Prolonged use of Dihydroxyacetone, especially on the more sensitive facial skin, alters collagen production and can result in premature wrinkling. Coupled with UV radiation from sun exposure, the facial skin will wrinkle and age faster. 
        It would be better for the skin to simply use a contouring stick or bronzing powder in the morning to achieve that glowy look. However, if you insist on contouring with a self-tanner, make sure you lather up with SPF each morning to prevent the premature aging effect. 


        <p style="font-family: Jaldi; font-size: 36px;margin-top: 10px;">Retinol.</p>
        Retinol is everywhere in people's skincare routines today, with everyone including 10-year-old Sephora girls lunging for retinol products. While some experts say kids should avoid retinol, others say everyone past 20 should be using it, and others believe it shouldn’t be touched at all, we need to deep-dive into what retinol is to understand the benefits and dangers. 
        Retinol is a form of Vitamin-A, and it functions on the skin by increasing cell turnover and collagen production. Essentially, it helps to exfoliate and get rid of dead skin cells to smoothen the appearance and tighten up the skin to reduce aging symptoms. However, using retinol when natural collagen production is still high can lead to tolerance development for collagen boost. Over time, the epidermis will fail to produce collagen alone. Therefore, you should only be using retinol if you are noticing skin sagging and wrinkling, or if your doctor recommends it. 

        <p style="font-family: Jaldi; font-size: 36px;margin-top: 10px;">Double Cleansing</p>
        Double cleansing has blown up on all social media platforms as a way to properly clean your pores. Double cleansing is a popular Korean technique where you first go in with a cleansing oil and then follow up with a water-based cleanser. With two cleansing steps, you might be hesitant to try it out if you have dry skin. But with the nature of double cleansing, you should give it a shot–no matter what skin type you have! 
        The oil-based cleanser will go into the pores to remove all the non-polar gunk (ex. oils from skin and makeup), while a water-based cleanser will remove all the polar dirt (ex. air germs, and debris). This will ensure that all dirt is removed from your face. Concerns about dry-ness are valid, however, an oil-based cleanser is rarely stripping because it emulsifies the skin barrier to hydrate.
        Double cleansing is definitely a yes from us! Just after 1 week of double cleansing with the Skinfix cleanser and Youth to the People cleanser, I’ve noticed a dramatic difference in the texture and complexion of my skin. If you try it out, leave us a comment down below to tell us how you like it!

        <p style="font-family: Jaldi; font-size: 36px;margin-top: 10px;">Shaving your face</p>
        We all have peach fuzz all over our faces, but are there benefits of removing it? Shaving your face removes the hair, but also removes a thin layer of dead skin and acts like a physical exfoliant. With this, you’re essentially smoothening the texture of your skin while allowing new cells to resurface. Many experts say that shaving the peach fuzz off allows for better skincare and makeup application. Although this is true, it’s also important to note that harsh physical exfoliants aren’t for all skin types. If you’re interested in shaving your face, you might want to start with super gentle micro razors for sensitive skin. Otherwise, this technique is great if you’re looking to amp up your skincare routine!

        <p style="font-family: Jaldi; font-size: 42px;margin-top: 10px;">Diving Deep into Toners and Essences</p>
        Unless you’re new to skincare, you know that the holy trinity of a good skincare routine consists of a cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF. Serums and eye creams obviously have their benefits in targeting certain skin concerns, but what’s the purpose of a toner/essence? 
       
        <p style="font-family: Jaldi; font-size: 36px;margin-top: 10px;">What’s a toner?</p>
        A toner is a water-based skincare product that is typically used right after cleansing the face. The main purpose of a toner is to help your other skincare products absorb better into the skin, but the function of each toner varies. 

        <p style="font-family: Jaldi; font-size: 36px;margin-top: 10px;">How does a toner do its job?</p>
        Toners can do their job by providing a subtle layer of hydration so that your other products can sink nicely into your epidermis. Similar to how a primer works to keep your makeup adhesive to your skin, a toner preps the skin to take in all the benefits of your products. 
        The ingredient that helps toners hydrate the skin is humectants. Humectants are ingredients that pull in additional moisture. If you layer a serum, moisturizer, and SPF on top of a toner containing humectants, the toner will help maximize the amount of hydration your skin gets by absorbing all the product into the skin. Look for toners containing ingredients like Glycerin, Peptides, Ceramides, and Hyaluronic acid for humectants. 
        Toners can also work by regulating the pH of your face. The pH of your face should ideally stay between 4.7-5.7 which is relatively acidic. However, most facial cleansers have a more basic pH to effectively remove all dirt and oils. In many cases, this cleansing and pH change can dry the skin out. To allow the skin to properly stay hydrated, a toner might contain an acidic ingredient to bring it back to its ideal pH range. Some great ingredients that do this are Citric Acid, Niacinamide, and Glycolic Acid. 

        <p style="font-family: Jaldi; font-size: 36px;margin-top: 10px;">Should you be using a toner?</p>
        Now for the big question: Should you be using a toner? There are so many benefits to using a toner, and we have many toner recommendations on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/projectsaveourskin/?next=%2Fsophiaxxia%2F" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@projectsaveourskin?_t=8XF7iTY6Ozr%_r=1" target="_blank">TikTok</a>. However, It’s not 100% essential to your skincare routine. It’s important to first get the basics of skincare down. For example, finding a good cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF for your skin. Next, it’s beneficial to explore what serums work for your specific skin concerns. If you have mastered these basics, it might be a good idea to explore some toner products to bring your skincare routine to the next level.
