        <p style="font-family: Jaldi; font-size: 42px;margin-top: 10px;">Glow Without the Risk: Why Airbrush Tans Are
          the Better Choice Over UV Tanning Beds</p>
        Social media has made the pursuit of the perfect golden glowy look more popular than ever. Everyone seems to
        want that sun-kissed look year-round—and honestly, we get it. But while a glowing tan might be a winter
        pick-me-up, there's a right and wrong way to achieve it.
        <br></br><br></br>
        To dive deeper into the world of tanning, we sat down with expert airbrush artist Denna, the founder of <a
          href="https://www.myairbrushgirl.com/">The Airbrush Girl</a>, a custom airbrush tanning service based in
        Chicago’s North Suburbs. Denna has been in the tanning industry since she was just 13, running an indoor tanning
        salon with her mom. Even then, she knew that UV
        tanning beds weren’t great for health. But everything changed when her supplier introduced her to
        Dihydroxyacetone (DHA), a chemical that reacts with the outer layer of dead skin to give it that tanned
        appearance without the harmful UV exposure.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Around that same time, Australia banned UV tanning beds—a move that caught Denna’s attention. Inspired, she made
        the switch to airbrush tanning, where she now uses formulas with 14-16% DHA. Unlike UV tanning, which takes time
        for the color to develop, airbrush tans give you a gorgeous, sun-kissed glow in just 24-48 hours. With proper
        care, the tan fades evenly, looks better, and—best of all—is much healthier. Plus, Denna’s solution is packed
        with Vitamin D3 for extra hydration and moisture, something UV tanning beds just can’t offer.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Denna’s clients include many who have battled skin cancer. For them—and anyone concerned about their
        skin—airbrush tanning is a lifesaver. It doesn’t speed up the aging process like UV tanning, which can lead to
        premature wrinkles and sun spots.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Now, let’s talk about the ugly truth behind indoor UV tanning beds. They’re addictive. People love them for the
        quick tan and the boost of Vitamin D, but every time you step into a tanning bed, your risk of developing skin
        cancer skyrockets by 20%. For those under 30, the risk is even higher. And if you care about your skin’s
        appearance UV exposure ages you fast, causing wrinkles and sun spots before their time.
        <br></br><br></br>
        <strong>So, if your goal is smooth, glowing skin, indoor tanning beds are not your friend.</strong>
        <br></br><br></br>
        If you’re looking for a healthy dose of Vitamin D or struggling with seasonal depression, there are far better
        ways to get your fix than baking under harmful UV rays. Red light therapy, infrared saunas, or even yoga are
        fantastic alternatives that not only boost your mood but also improve your overall health.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Denna’s clients are all about living a healthy, balanced lifestyle. They take care of their skin, they work out,
        and they treat themselves to spa days. Skipping UV tanning beds isn’t just about preventing skin cancer—it’s
        part of a broader approach to staying healthy and making smart choices for your body and skin.
        <br></br><br></br>
