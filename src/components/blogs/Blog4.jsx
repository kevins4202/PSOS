        Is your skin ready to face the fall? With the upcoming cool and windy weather, we need to update our skincare
        routines! Here are some essentials that’ll help you keep your skin safe and sound (from the spooky ghosts!) this
        fall:
        <br></br><br></br>
        The summer might have left you with some hyperpigmentation or other skin problems. No worries! You can use the
        “VOTARY Sensitive Resurfacing Peel”.
        <br></br><br></br>
        A thick and hydrating moisturizer is a must-have to avoid dry skin and wrinkles! You can also use oils or
        oil-infused moisturizers like the “Naturium Glow Better Body Oil” and “Multi-Oil Body Butter”. The most popular
        way to hydrate your skin is slugging. Ever heard of this trend on TikTok? If not, the name explains it well. You
        use occlusive products, like Vaseline, to apply it to your face (recommended for PM skincare routine). Due to
        vaseline being very “greasy” and “slimy” it replicates how slugs feel – that’s why it’s called slugging! Another
        great moisturizer is the “Rhode Barrier Restore Cream”, made by your favorite, Hailey Bieber.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Serums are the holy grail of skincare, and they are always in-season! And you probably can already tell where
        this is going. Get hydrating serums! You can use this as part of your AM routine as hydrating serums feel more
        lightweight than cream moisturizers, but will still do the job! Popular TikToker, Natalie Aguilar, loves using
        the “Le Prunier Plum Beauty Oil”. Argan oil is also widely used.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Ever heard the phrase “you are what you eat”? Well then invest in nutrients and electrolytes this fall! They
        will benefit in protecting and hydrating your skin barrier. Another favorite of Aguilar is the “Cure Hydrating
        Electrolyte Mix”.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Last but not least, using a scalp serum is also necessary to prevent dandruff! “This Hair of Mine” by Cyndia
        Harvey is a great option!
