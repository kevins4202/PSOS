        Our topic today is basal cell carcinoma cancer. Sounds complex, right? Well actually, it is a type of cancer that is
        caused by prolonged exposure to the sun during high UV levels (UV-radiation). This cancer mutates in our basal
        cells: Cells that work to produce new skin cells in place of our dead cells. That’s why it’s important to
        exfoliate your face – to reveal your shining new skin. What does it look like? It looks like a bump/scar, either
        pink or brown/black colored (depending on your skin tone), with a transparent wax-like cover.
        <br></br><br></br>Now, here are some tips to prevent this cancer: Wear sunscreen and get some shade! Sunscreen creates a barrier
        between your skin and the sun, so the UV rays cannot irritate your skin as much. And another great way to avoid
        UV rays is getting some shade, especially earlier in the day (10 a.m - 4 p.m.) as that is when UV levels are the
        highest. Also, another popular beauty procedure, tanning beds, can be particularly dangerous. Tanning beds emit
        UV rays with close contact to your skin, so it is not recommended to consistently use them. That is all you need
        to know to protect your beautiful skin!
